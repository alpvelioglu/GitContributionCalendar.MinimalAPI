# Git Contribution Calendar API  

A high-performance **.NET 9 Minimal API** compiled with **NativeAOT**, providing Bitbucket Server specific data. It's designed for experimental things.

## Purpose  

This API was developed for [Git Contribution Calendar Angular](https://github.com/alpvelioglu/git-contribution-calendar-angular) to bypass Bitbucket Server's CORS policy.  

If you prefer not to use this API, you can opt for Angular's proxy mechanism, which is available in [Git Contribution Calendar Angular](https://github.com/alpvelioglu/git-contribution-calendar-angular) repository.

## Installation  

1. Ensure you have the **.NET 9 SDK** installed.
2. Check [Native AOT Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=windows%2Cnet8) for necessary packages
3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.  
4. Run the application using:  

   ```sh
   dotnet run
