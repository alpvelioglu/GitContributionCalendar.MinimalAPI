# Git Contribution Calendar API  

A high-performance **.NET 9 Minimal API** compiled with **NativeAOT**, providing Bitbucket Server specific data.

## Purpose  

This API was developed for [Git Contribution Calendar Angular](https://github.com/alpvelioglu/git-contribution-calendar-angular) to bypass Bitbucket Server's CORS policy.  

If you prefer not to use this API, you can opt for Angular's proxy mechanism, which is available in [Git Contribution Calendar Angular](https://github.com/alpvelioglu/git-contribution-calendar-angular) repository.
